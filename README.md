# Expense Tracker

The user interface is designed as follows:

In this React project, I have used **hooks** and **Context APIs**. Each part of the UI is implemented as a separate component, including the **Header**, **Balance Component**, **Income-Expense Component**, **Transaction List**, **Transaction Component**, and **Add Transaction Component**. 

All components are functional components, and I have organized them within a dedicated `components` folder to maintain a clean and structured codebase.
